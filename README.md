# Super Arduino de Compras (S.A.C) 🦸‍♂️🛒
🦸🏿‍♀️🦸🏻‍♂️ An ambitious, Arduino-based project to monitor physical shopping carts.

## **What is our main goal for the project?**
We create this project because it seems important to us to take care of our health, and above all, after having lived through a situation like this. Therefore, to find a solution, it occurred to us to monitor a shopping cart using light sensors. In this way, we would save ourselves from having to touch the cars that other people have touched. This will help prevent new Covid-19 infections.

## **How it works?**
We have developed a cart that follows you wherever you go, using a light sensor that follows the green light to which it connects. Instead, if the light turns red, it stops. The operation is simple, when you enter the supermarket you receive a bracelet with a code and it connects to a cart, small or large. Afterwards, you go to the supermarket and do the shopping as usual, the only thing that changes is that you don't have to push the cart. When moving the bracelet will emit a green light and the car will be ordered to follow it, until you stop. By doing so, the bracelet will immediately change color to red and the car will be ordered to stop.

## **For which platform is your project oriented?**
It's oriented for Arduino.

## It really works?
**Theoretically it could work, although, as this is a school project, it may not be of much help in real life.**

      <strong>What is our main goal for the project?</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      We create this project because it seems important to us to take care of
      our health, and above all, after having lived through a situation like
      this. Therefore, to find a solution, it occurred to us to monitor a
      shopping cart using light sensors. In this way, we would save ourselves
      from having to touch the cars that other people have touched. This will
      help prevent new Covid-19 infections.
    </p>
    <h2 id="-how-it-works-"><strong>How it works?</strong></h2>
    <p>
      We have developed a cart that follows you wherever you go, using a light
      sensor that follows the green light to which it connects. Instead, if the
      light turns red, it stops. The operation is simple, when you enter the
      supermarket you receive a bracelet with a code and it connects to a cart,
      small or large. Afterwards, you go to the supermarket and do the shopping
      as usual, the only thing that changes is that you don&#39;t have to push
      the cart. When moving the bracelet will emit a green light and the car
      will be ordered to follow it, until you stop. By doing so, the bracelet
      will immediately change color to red and the car will be ordered to stop.
